### A common mistake with this is people will thing its 11 but its not.
### Its actualy 10. This is because in programming numbers dont start
### at 1. They start at 0. Therefore the program runs the code with 
### the following result:

# ----> 0
#       1
#       2
#       3
#       4
#       5
#       6
#       7
#       8
#       9
#      10
